# DBSCAN-Clustering
DBSCAN Clustering<br>
DBSCAN is a density based clustering algorithm, used to find clusters based on density parameters<br>
This algorithm enables us to find clusters of arbitrary shape. <br>
We will try different clustering algorithms on the given dataset  Kmeans, Kmedoids and DBScan<br>
We will also vary density parameters of DBSCAN and note the changes in clusters found.<br>
Cluster the datasets given using <br>
DBSCAN –try different values of eps and MinPts.<br>
Kmeans–find optimum k value <br>
Compute the Silhouette Coefficient for the clustering.<br> 
Plot clusters using Matplotlib<br>

Comment on the results.<br>
1) What is the maximum silhouette coefficient obtained for each clustering and which algorithm gave the same? <br>
2) What were the parameters used to get that model? (i.e. eps and Minptsor K-value)<br>
